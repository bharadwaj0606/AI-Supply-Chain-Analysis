# AI-Supply-Chain-Analysis
This project mainly depicts the yield of apple product in an area based on various parameters like temperature(C), soil moisture(%) and rainfall(mm).
The first step involves setting the environment, selecting appropriate model for our project.
Based on the requirements for my project, I have selected t5 model for analysis.
The second step involves selecting the product for Supply Chain Analysis and collecting relavant data for training the model.
As I don't have real-time data, I have generated synthetic data for my product(Apple).
The third step involves training our model with the data collected.
The fourth step involves testing the model by using data that we have not used for training our model(Unseen data).
The fifth step involves optimising the model. It involves cleaning the data(removing outliers, finding the tuples which have missing values, replacing missing values with mean value or universal value of data).
